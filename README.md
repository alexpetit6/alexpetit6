- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Petit
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything outdoors!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything coding, related. I'm constantly teaching myself new methods in every language I write in.
- ğŸ’ª My current project is a website I'm building for a local non-profit garden club. All that's left are the finishing front-end touches.
