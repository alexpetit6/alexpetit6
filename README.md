- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex Petit
- Having recently finished General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, I have not stopped coding and building my skills since. Everyday I make it a mission to learn more about every aspect of software development to make myself a more well-rounded coder. During the time I've spent so far on the keyboard I have found myself naturally gravitating towards a preference for front-end development. I believe I have a natural eye for what looks good and can make valuable contributions to the overall design of a product. Finding coding has been a blessing, it has been amazing finding something I love to do and finally finding a path for myself.
